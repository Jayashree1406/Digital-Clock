🕒 Digital Clock with Real-Time Day & Date

This project is a real-time digital clock built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays the current time, day of the week, and full date, updating every second. The clock features a clean, responsive design and easy to integrate into any webpage or personal dashboard. I used JavaScript's Date object along with the setTimeout() function for real-time updates.

📅 Day and Date Display — Clearly shows the current weekday (e.g., Tuesday) and full date (e.g., July 2, 2025).

💻 Responsive UI — Designed to adapt seamlessly to both desktop and mobile screens.

⚙ Minimal & Lightweight — Built using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript — no external libraries or frameworks.
